# Introduction

My name is Erin Liebe and I am a sophomore from Stafford, Virginia. I just transferred from Christendom College to pursue a marketing degree. I like to play soccer, garden, decorate, take pictures, and spend time on the water. I really enjoy exploring new places wih my parents and three siblings. My family is Canadian so we typically spend summers in Canada. This is the first summer ever that I have spent completely in the states! Recently my favorite place to visit has been D.C., where you can find me in the West Building of the National Gallery of Art or strolling through the Mary Livingston Ripley Garden. I am currently reading "The Beautiful Truth" by Mark Anthony and my favorite band is Lake Street Dive.
